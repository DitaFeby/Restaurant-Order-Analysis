# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This project establishes a database system, restaurant_db, designed to support the operational management of a restaurant. It provides a structured framework to:

- Track customer orders through the order_details table, which records order information, including the order ID, date, time, and associated menu items.
- Manage the restaurant's offerings with the menu_items table, containing details about each menu item, including its name, category, and price.

The objective of analyzing the provided data is to gain insights into key operational and financial aspects of the restaurant's performance. Specifically, the analysis will focus on the following goals:
- Evaluate total revenue and sales patterns to assess the restaurant's profitability and growth potential.
- Analyze the performance of individual menu items to identify the best-sellers and underperforming items.
- Identify any patterns that could inform marketing strategies, staffing requirements, or special promotions.
- Based on the findings, actionable recommendations will be provided to enhance business performance


**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1. Weekday Optimization
Lunch Promotion: Maximize weekday lunch sales by introducing lunch combos or discounts that include Edamame with popular main side dishes

2. Boost Weekend Performance
Weekend-Exclusive Promotions: Encourage more weekend traffic by offering special deals, such as discounts on Korean Beef Bowl or family-sized meals.
Brunch Options: Since sales pick up around lunch, introduce brunch specials to capture more early-day sales.

3. Combo Strategy
Bundle Offers with Edamame: Create bundled meal deals featuring Edamame and popular main dishes (e.g., Hamburger or Cheeseburger). 
Highlight its versatility as a side dish in marketing materials.

4. Operational Enhancements
