# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This project establishes a database system, restaurant_db, designed to support the operational management of a restaurant. It provides a structured framework to:

- Track customer orders through the order_details table, which records order information, including the order ID, date, time, and associated menu items.
- Manage the restaurant's offerings with the menu_items table, containing details about each menu item, including its name, category, and price.

The objective of analyzing the provided data is to gain insights into key operational and financial aspects of the restaurant's performance. Specifically, the analysis will focus on the following goals:
- Evaluate total revenue and sales patterns to assess the restaurant's profitability and growth potential.
- Analyze the performance of individual menu items to identify the best-sellers and underperforming items.
- Identify any patterns that could inform marketing strategies, staffing requirements, or special promotions.
- Based on the findings, actionable recommendations will be provided to enhance business performance
