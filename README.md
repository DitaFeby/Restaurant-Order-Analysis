# Restaurant-Order-Analysis
This project establishes a database system, restaurant_db, designed to support the operational management of a restaurant. It provides a structured framework to:

Track customer orders through the order_details table, which records order information, including the order ID, date, time, and associated menu items.
Manage the restaurant's offerings with the menu_items table, containing details about each menu item, including its name, category, and price.
